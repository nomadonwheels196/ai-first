# üß† Ai-First MVP Product Spec  
**Version:** v0.1  
**Owner:** Travis Sheppard  
**Target MVP Release:** End of 2025  

---

## 1. Product Overview  
Ai-First is a **proactive AI coaching platform** that lives where people work ‚Äî not in a course, but in their daily workflow.  
It measures how users think, act, and engage with AI, then **guides them through personalized enablement journeys** to turn curiosity into capability and capability into productivity.  

This MVP focuses on:
1. Assessing AI maturity (Level 0‚Äì4 framework)  
2. Building adaptive user profiles  
3. Delivering personalized enablement paths  

---

## 2. Problem Statement  
AI adoption inside organizations is **fragmented and shallow**.  
Tools are abundant; habits are not.  
Employees ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù with AI but rarely integrate it into workflows.  
The result: lots of licenses, little transformation.  

**Ai-First bridges that gap** by embedding behavioral coaching directly into work ‚Äî helping people evolve from ‚ÄúAI curious‚Äù to ‚ÄúAI-first.‚Äù

## 10. Open Questions / Decisions
1. Should Level assessments be **self-reported** or **behaviorally inferred**?  
2. How do we balance **privacy vs. visibility** in workflow data?  
3. Should the enablement path be **static (rules-based)** or **adaptive (AI-driven)** in MVP?  
4. What minimum viable integrations (e.g., Gmail, Slack, Notion) unlock the most value?  
5. Should users see **team-level benchmarking** or only personal growth?
