# Core Customers

**Version:** v1.0  
**Owner:** Travis Sheppard

## Initial Target
We start with **large enterprises** (B2B) because:
- They have the biggest productivity and transformation potential
- They already invest in AI but lack adoption
- ROI from AI adoption can be measured at a **workflow + business level**

## Expansion Path (Market Sequencing)
1. **Enterprise** – AI workforce transformation platform
2. **Mid-Market / SMB** – scaled self-serve version
3. **Consumer (B2C)** – personal AI coach for careers and capability
