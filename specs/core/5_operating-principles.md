1. **Serve people first** – We help humans, not just enterprises
2. **Communication over complexity** – Clear > clever
3. **Own the problem** – Local problems = individual ownership. System problems = leadership ownership.
4. **Disagree with purpose, then commit** – Openly challenge → execute together
5. **Autonomy with accountability** – Freedom to act, responsibility to deliver
6. **Habits over hacks** – We drive lasting change, not novelty
7. **We use what we build** – Ai First team runs Ai First
