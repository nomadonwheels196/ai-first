# Boundaries

**Version:** v1.0  
**Owner:** Travis Sheppard

## What We Won’t Do
- Replace human creativity or decision-making
- Build another AI chatbot platform
- Sell fear-based “AI risk” narratives
- Optimize vanity metrics over impact
- Build hype instead of value

---

## Strategic Guardrails
- We integrate into current workflows first for maximum buy-in and quick impact, but our goal is to empower people to redefine and transform those workflows with Ai
- Transformation is not about forcing tool change. It’s about evolving how people think and work, then letting workflows and tools follow
- We measure **real user outcomes**
- We stay true to our mission of **human empowerment**
