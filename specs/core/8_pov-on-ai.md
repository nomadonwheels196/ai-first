## Our Philosophy
AI is not here to replace humans. AI is here to **extend human potential**.

---

## Core Beliefs
- AI should **augment human ability**
- AI is **behavioral**, not just technical
- AI must be **accessible to all**
- Value doesn’t come from building more — it comes from using better
- Adoption and conversation are the real multipliers
- AI is a **tool**, not a god or a threat
- Humans decide **what and why** — AI helps with **how**
