## Role Purpose
The Chief Architect at **Ai First** is responsible for designing and guiding the long-term technical architecture of our platform. This role ensures that Ai First builds scalable, coherent, and future-proof systems that enable human + AI workflows at global scale. The Chief Architect creates leverage through clean system design, clear technical standards, and deep architectural decision-making.

Unlike theoretical architects, this role is **hands-on** and involved in complex design and implementation. The Chief Architect is also a senior customer-facing technical leader who partners directly with enterprise customers, Solutions Architects, and field engineering to ensure real-world deployment success. This role serves as the technical glue across AI, platform, product, and DevOps teams—driving architectural cohesion while ensuring execution aligns with strategy and customer value.

---

## Mission of the Role
Build a technical architecture that:
- Scales from MVP to millions of users
- Supports complex, contextual AI coaching systems
- Enables fast iteration without sacrificing core integrity
- Balances local-first computing with cloud orchestration
- Supports secure, privacy-respecting AI deployment

---

## Responsibilities

### 1. Architecture Strategy
- Define and evolve Ai First’s long-term technical architecture
- Create roadmap for technical systems that match product strategy
- Own core architectural principles and technical decision frameworks
- Ensure systems are simple, modular, and extensible

### 2. System Design Leadership
- Lead design of distributed systems and AI infrastructure
- Design interaction layers between platform, AI systems, and product features
- Build system diagrams, architectural specs, and reference implementations
- Review and approve major technical decisions

### 3. AI System Architecture
- Architect modular AI runtime and agent orchestration engine
- Build evaluation pipelines and AI system quality frameworks
- Support hybrid AI compute (local inference + cloud augmentation)
- Ensure safety, resilience, and auditability of AI systems

### 4. Engineering Collaboration
- Partner with CTO and Director of Platform Engineering on architecture
- Provide deep technical guidance to engineering teams
- Review critical implementation plans and unblock technical challenges
- Mentor engineers in architectural thinking and system design

### 5. Tech Debt & Evolution
- Identify long-term risks in system design
- Drive architecture evolution plans without blocking delivery
- Create scalable standards for APIs, services, and integration
- Balance innovation and maintainability

### 6. Cross-Team Alignment & Customer Engagement
- Act as senior technical partner in strategic enterprise customer conversations
- Align architecture with real customer needs and deployment realities
- Serve as the technical glue across AI, platform, product, and DevOps teams
- Partner with Product to translate customer pain into architectural improvements
- Provide enablement and architectural guidance to Solutions Architects and field engineering
- Support complex proof-of-concepts and high-impact customer implementations
