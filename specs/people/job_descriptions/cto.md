## Role Purpose
The CTO at **Ai First** is responsible for building the technical architecture and engineering organization that brings our mission to life. This role owns the strategy, systems, and execution that enable Ai First to deliver a scalable, secure, and high-performance coaching platform powered by AI.

The CTO is a **builder-leader** who writes strategy through code and systems—not PowerPoints. This role is accountable for the quality, velocity, and reliability of product delivery.

---

## Mission of the Role
Build and lead the engineering organization that:
- Ships an **MVP by end of 2025**
- Achieves **Product–Market Fit by mid-2026**
- Scales the platform to serve **millions of users globally**
- Drives **AI adoption through real workflow impact**

---

## Responsibilities

### 1. Technical Strategy & Architecture
- Define and own the long-term product architecture
- Ensure the platform is scalable, modular, and spec-driven
- Lead AI system design: agents, inference strategy, context management, and personalization
- Make architecture decisions that maximize **speed + durability**

### 2. Engineering Execution & Delivery
- Build an engineering organization capable of **high-velocity iterative releases**
- Implement **spec-first development** (clarity before code)
- Own delivery timelines and engineering quality
- Architect systems that evolve quickly without breaking stability

### 3. AI Systems & Innovation
- Extend the Ai First coach into a **personalized, local-first AI system**
- Drive intelligent context awareness and workflow coaching capabilities
- Establish **evaluation frameworks** to measure AI output quality and safety
- Balance innovation velocity with reliability and user trust

### 4. Security, Data, and Infrastructure
- Own security, privacy, and compliance by design
- Build safe human-in-the-loop guardrails
- Define infrastructure strategy (local compute + hybrid cloud + edge)
- Ensure data architecture supports personalization at scale

### 5. Team & Leadership
- Recruit world-class engineering talent
- Build a **high-trust, ownership-first engineering culture**
- Create engineering operating rhythms and processes
- Mentor and level up engineers through systems thinking

## What Success Looks Like
| Timeframe | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| 3 months | MVP architecture and technical spec defined |
| 6 months | First version of Ai First Coach live |
| 12 months | Engineering org in place and shipping weekly |
| 18 months | Product–Market Fit supported by scalable architecture |
| 36 months | Global AI platform serving millions |

---

## Key Metrics
- Engineering velocity (time-to-ship)
- Platform reliability (SLA / uptime / bug rate)
- System scalability and performance metrics
- Architecture adaptability (time to extend features)
- AI quality and adoption metrics

---

## Requirements

### Must Have
- Proven experience building and scaling engineering teams
- Expertise in AI systems architecture and product engineering
- Deep hands-on technical capability (can prototype independently)
- Strong execution leadership and delivery track record
- Experience building production AI systems or agent-based systems

### Nice to Have
- Background in operating system-level engineering, local-first AI, or privacy-first ML systems
- Experience building developer platforms
- Startup founding or 0→1 experience

### DNA
- Builder > theorist
- Systems thinker
- Bias for speed and clarity
- Mission-driven and resilient
- First-principles decision maker

---

## Leadership Principles for This Role
- Ship fast, improve continuously
- Build leverage through systems, not headcount
- Push for simplicity and clarity in architecture
- Solve user problems, not engineering vanity
- Create engineers who think, not just code
