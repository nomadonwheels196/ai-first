## Mission of the Role
Build a scalable and extensible platform that:
- Enables product teams to ship fast with confidence
- Powers intelligent, context-aware AI coaching systems
- Scales from early users to millions globally
- Supports hybrid compute (local + cloud) architecture
- Creates strong engineering leverage across teams

## Responsibilities

### 1. Platform Architecture & Systems
- Own core platform architecture and evolution
- Design modular systems for speed and long-term scale
- Build the platform around **clear specs and contracts**
- Enable reliable, observable, and maintainable systems

### 2. Developer Experience (DevEx)
- Build internal platform tools for product engineering
- Improve build speed, local development, debugging, and testing flows
- Own CI/CD and release automation
- Reduce friction for engineers across all teams

### 3. AI Infrastructure
- Implement systems for LLM orchestration, context management, and caching
- Build model abstraction layers for vendor flexibility
- Optimize cost, latency, and reliability
- Support offline + privacy-first AI inference when possible

### 4. Observability & Reliability
- Build monitoring, logging, and resilience into the platform
- Create meaningful performance dashboards
- Establish platform SLAs and service ownership standards
- Lead incident response and reliability reviews

### 5. Leadership & Team Building
- Build and lead a world-class Platform Engineering team
- Drive a **spec-first culture** across engineering
- Mentor engineers in systems thinking and scalable design
- Partner with product and AI teams to align strategy and execution
