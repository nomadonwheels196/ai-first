## Role Purpose
The Product Manager (PM) at **Ai First** owns problem definition, product clarity, and outcome delivery. This role ensures we build products that customers actually use and that drive measurable AI adoption and workflow transformation. The PM is the connector between users, engineering, design, and the business—owning *what* we build, *why* we build it, and *how we measure success*.

This is not a project manager role. PMs at Ai First are **strategic product owners** who lead through clarity and customer obsession.
