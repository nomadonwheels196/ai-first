## Role Purpose
Founding Engineers at **Ai First** are builders who turn vision into working systems. This role is for someone who wants to build product, shape architecture, influence engineering culture, and solve hard problems with speed and ownership. Founding Engineers are not feature coders—they are product-focused system designers who obsess over impact.

---

## Mission of the Role
Ship high-quality product fast while shaping the engineering foundation of Ai First.

- Build the Ai First Coach MVP and iterate to v1
- Turn specifications into product reality
- Create leverage through clean architecture and reusable systems
- Make engineering decisions that balance speed,  durability, and cost
- Help Ai First reach **Product–Market Fit by 2026**

---

## Responsibilities

### 1. Product Engineering
- Build core features of the Ai First Coach across desktop platforms (Mac & Windows)
- Implement real-time AI coaching and workflow integration
- Integrate third-party AI APIs, local inference models, and context systems
- Collaborate tightly with design and product to ship impactful functionality
- Convert clear specifications into high-quality code

### 2. System Design & Architecture
- Design modular, scalable systems that evolve quickly
- Write code that is simple, maintainable, and built for iteration
- Participate in architectural decision-making
- Keep technical debt low and momentum high

### 3. AI Integration
- Work with LLMs, embeddings, vector stores, and context windows
- Design interaction loops for shadowing, guidance, and agent actions
- Implement evaluation tools and quality guardrails
- Push the boundaries of **human + AI workflow systems**

### 4. Culture & Ownership
- Model **ownership mindset**—own problems end-to-end
- Contribute to a **spec-first engineering culture**
- Move fast without breaking trust or quality
- Collaborate openly and communicate clearly

## Requirements

### Must Have
- Strong full-stack or systems engineering capability
- Ability to build and ship independently
- Experience with AI development (LLMs/APIs/agents)
- Startup experience or demonstrated ownership mindset
- Comfort working in ambiguity and high velocity environments

### Nice to Have
- Desktop app experience (Electron, Tauri, Swift, or similar)
- Local AI/edge compute development
- Background in product engineering or HCI
- Experience designing workflow systems

### DNA
- Builder > talker
- Curious and hungry to learn
- Bias for clarity and execution
- Pragmatic problem solver
- Mission-driven and resilient
