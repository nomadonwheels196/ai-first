## Role Purpose
The DevOps Engineer at **Ai First** builds and owns the infrastructure and automation systems that enable fast, reliable product delivery. This role ensures our engineering teams can ship safely and with confidence by creating scalable deployment pipelines, observability systems, and platform reliability practices.

This is a **hands-on engineering role** focused on building leverage for the entire product and platform team. The DevOps Engineer isn’t just responsible for tooling—they are responsible for **engineering velocity and platform stability**.

---

## Mission of the Role
Build and scale DevOps foundations that:
- Enable rapid product iteration and delivery
- Improve platform stability, uptime, and resiliency
- Automate deployment and testing workflows
- Support hybrid compute (local + cloud + AI infrastructure)
- Increase engineering speed and reduce operational friction

---

## Responsibilities

### 1. CI/CD and Release Automation
- Build and maintain CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Improve build speed and deployment reliability
- Standardize release workflows across engineering
- Enable safe feature rollout (feature flags, release channels)

### 2. Infrastructure Management
- Build and manage cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Implement infrastructure as code (Terraform or Pulumi)
- Design scalable environments for development, staging, and production
- Optimize infra performance and cost

### 3. Observability & Reliability
- Implement logging, monitoring, tracing, and alerting systems
- Build dashboards for service health and performance
- Manage incident response and postmortem processes
- Improve platform SLAs and response time

### 4. AI Productionization Support
- Support deployment of AI services (LLM orchestration, inference APIs)
- Build infrastructure for evaluation and AI quality monitoring
- Manage GPU resources and model serving optimization
- Implement guardrails and safety checks in pipelines

### 5. Security & Compliance
- Implement DevSecOps practices
- Manage secrets, identity, and access security
- Ensure compliance-ready systems (SOC2-ready approach)
- Support data protection and safety

## What Success Looks Like
| Timeframe | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| 60 days | CI/CD pipeline live with automated deployments |
| 90 days | Monitoring and alerts in place for key systems |
| 6 months | Strong engineering velocity with reliable releases |
| 12 months | Production-grade DevOps systems powering scale |

---

## Key Metrics
- Deployment frequency
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Build time and release cycle time
- System uptime and reliability
- Developer experience satisfaction (internal NPS)

---

## Requirements

### Must Have
- Strong DevOps engineering experience (CI/CD, cloud, IaC)
- Experience with modern automation tools (GitHub Actions, Argo, CircleCI)
- Strong skills in AWS/Azure/GCP architecture
- Experience with Docker and container orchestration
- Knowledge of modern observability tools (Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, etc.)

### Nice to Have
- Experience with AI production systems
- Kubernetes experience
- Security automation experience
- Startup or high-growth environment experience

### DNA
- System thinker
- Obsessed with automation
- Reliable and disciplined engineer
- Builder mindset
- Ownership mentality

---

## Leadership Principles for This Role
- Automate everything repeatable
- Reliability is a feature
- Clarity over complexity
- Speed with safety
- Own the pipeline, enable the product
