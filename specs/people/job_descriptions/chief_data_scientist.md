### 3. Personalization & Context Systems
- Build user modeling and workflow pattern recognition
- Enable dynamic coaching based on skill level and behavior
- Develop agent memory, embeddings, and long-term context strategies

### 4. Model Operations (MLOps)
- Own model lifecycle: selection, adaptation, evaluation, deployment
- Optimize AI performance across latency, cost, and quality tradeoffs
- Build model telemetry and improvement pipelines
- Support hybrid AI (local + cloud) strategy

### 5. Research & Product Innovation
- Explore new agent architectures, coaching strategies, and interaction models
- Collaborate with product to bring research innovations into production
- Publish findings internally to create a learning culture

### 6. Responsible AI
- Build human-in-the-loop guardrails and safety evaluation systems
- Define AI ethics principles and transparency guidelines
- Ensure model behavior aligns with user trust and company values
